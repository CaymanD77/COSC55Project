# COSC55Project
Github Wiki for Omar and Cayman's COSC 55 final project.


## Area of Interest:
We are planning to do our research project around cloud services to securely store, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. Not only is this an extremely important part of cybersecurity in general, we both found the lessons in class discussing this topic very interesting. We are hoping to, throughout the course of this project, learn more about common methods within the industry for manipulating secure information, find effective ways to implement this type of security within our AWS environment, and be able to understand in depth current trends, practices, and dangers associated with this type of security.

## Relevant AWS Services:
1. AWS Secrets Manager
2. AWS Key Management Service
3. AWS Identify and Access Management
4. AWS Certificate Manager
5. AWS Lambda
